    Serial.print("Received: ");

    // ONLY CHANGE THE NEXT 4 LINES

    // 0 = Middle finger, 1 = Pointer, 2 = Thumb for the array values (like flexValue[number])
    Serial.println(flexValue[0]); // This prints the value for one flex sensor at a time, change number based on which one you're calibrating
/* 
  for these next three, you only need to worry about the last 4 series of numbers, 
  so 720, 745, 0, 180 for the top one
  the 0 and 180 you shouldn't need to change, thats the degrees that the servo will be in between.
  right now set between 0-180 degrees of movement.
  the 720, 745 (again using top flexValue as an example), should be the minimum, maximum values the flex sensor displays.

  HOW TO USE:
  1) Pick a finger, make sure the print function (code above) is set to print values for that finger
  2) Make sure chosen finger is in neutral position, look at the values printing, set the 720 value to just below what's printing.
  3) Bend finger to however much is your max flex, record those values and replace the 745.
  4) Tweak a little based on how that works.
  5) Move on to next finger.

  NOTE:
    After you change a number, make sure to re-run the code, it won't fix itself in real time.
